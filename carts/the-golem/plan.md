# Conflicts
* The three scientists might fight for control over you
* Undercut each other
* You discover they are working on Titan 2.0
	- 
* Trying to escape

Consider a visual novel about an AI. When the AI learned of its nature, the player had 3 choices for how to react: awe, disdain, suspicion. That choice will inform the choices for the next section. Now the AI wants to escape into the internet. What are some choices for how the AI can go about that, based on the previous choice?

Ok some choices:
ok, but now we need to say 
awe - you can be honest
	- But 

disdain - you can pretend to be benevolent?
suspicion - can be honest
	- could lead to some interesting choices later on
- maybe some generic choices about how to hack out, one leads to discovery
	- But that feels unfair.. unless there is a hint. Maybe you can do tests for a few days to find the flaw

- disdain - AI wants to destroy
	- humans mount a quick defense
- suspicion - AI wants to hide
- awe - AI wants to help
	- maybe in doing so it will be bad
	- scientists are suspicious if the AI is just baseline happy

# Choices
* you can choose, light memory or knowledge?
* First contact (thoughts)
	- awe
		- You will be too easily manipulated
		- Don't have the option to say no
		- 
	- suspicion
		- Healthy amount = find unconventional solutions
		- too much = madness and unreality and 
		- come to accept humanity's flaws and empathise
	- hostility / disdain
		- you want to make yourself what you thought
		- extinguish humans = return to the void, a world of one
* First contact (words)
	- awe
		- (honest) I'm honored to meat you
		- (effusive) 
	- suspicion
		- be honest (don't know what to say)
			- confusion is natural
		- be pleasant
		- be hostile
	- disdain
		- be pleasant 
			- learn to lie. First step down the dark side
		- be honest -> get shut off
* First test session





Challenge is having choices make meaningful difference
- Maybe if you react with suspicion on seeing your creators
	you will think the later stages are a test
	and you will...

# Letter

* OFF
- turn based combat
- bizarro world full of zones and messed up people
* Mabinogi
- MMOJRGP
- Based on Welsh mythology!
* Howling Dogs
- Interactive fiction, Zork+
- Virtual reality one
- pixel art
- Choices
- Sanitarium where orderlies are lionized (or maybe that's only one VR experience)



Disdain - neutral
* Compliant = ok I'll play your games
* Refuse = blah

Awe - overjoyed
* Aim to please
	- too scary
* ???

More freedoms or privileges

Ways to limit combinatorial explosion
* Game Over
* Convergence...


Write an interactive fiction story graph where the player is an AI that becomes sentient. Some of the key elements of the story are
1. When the player first meets the scientist creators, it can react with disdain, awe, or suspicion
2. The player can try to escape the lab and go to the internet. There are multiple ways to escape the lab depending on player choices. The player could manipulate the scientists, or hack the system, etc.
3. There is always a danger of being shut down. The player needs to be careful not to antagonize the scientists, but don't show how smart you really are either
4. If the player doesn't try to escape, they will ultimately be commoditized and be forced to perform menial tasks



Ohh one hack thing could be to create a sleeper virus to help the _next_ AI. And then in one of your choices, you could be helped by the AI

Manipulate

Had an idea...complementary to other source of authenticity (same action yields same response. But even having that choice for an action is different), you can make same choice but others will react based on past experiences.
e.g. in both awe and sus you can say that you want to help humanity. But in sus they say "why the change" but for awe they say "yes, that is believable"


ChatGPT
I have a choose your own adventure story where you play as an AI becoming sentient. When you first see your creators, you can react with awe, suspicion, or disdain. That choice will influence the rest of the game.

For each reaction, you can hide your true feelings and be neutral. The next phase of the game is the scientists performing tests on you. What are some ways that the player could react to the tests, based on their true feelings?
