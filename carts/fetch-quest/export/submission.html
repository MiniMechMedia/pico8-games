<p>Who let the dogs in outer space?</p>
<!-- BREAK -->

<p>Run and jump along the walls of the space station to eat bones. 
Don't eat the radio-active red bone though!</p>
<h2>Controls</h2>
<ul>
<li>Arrow keys - move</li>
<li>X - jump / restart on game over</li>
</ul>
<h2>Hints</h2>
<ul>
<li>After jumping, your controls have no effect until you hit the wall</li>
<li>When you eat bones in free fall, you build up a multiplier that makes the next bone worth more</li>
</ul>
