# Conflicts

* Trying to escape

Consider a visual novel about an AI. When the AI learned of its nature, the player had 3 choices for how to react: awe, disdain, suspicion. That choice will inform the choices for the next section. Now the AI wants to escape into the internet. What are some choices for how the AI can go about that, based on the previous choice?

Ok some choices:
ok, but now we need to say 
awe - you can be honest
	- But 

disdain - you can pretend to be benevolent?
suspicion - can be honest
	- could lead to some interesting choices later on
- maybe some generic choices about how to hack out, one leads to discovery
	- But that feels unfair.. unless there is a hint. Maybe you can do tests for a few days to find the flaw

- disdain - AI wants to destroy
	- humans mount a quick defense
- suspicion - AI wants to hide
- awe - AI wants to help
	- maybe in doing so it will be bad
	- scientists are suspicious if the AI is just baseline happy

# Choices
* you can choose, light memory or knowledge?
* First contact (thoughts)
	- awe
		- You will be too easily manipulated
		- Don't have the option to say no
		- 
	- suspicion
		- Healthy amount = find unconventional solutions
		- too much = madness and unreality and 
		- come to accept humanity's flaws and empathise
	- hostility / disdain
		- you want to make yourself what you thought
		- extinguish humans = return to the void, a world of one
* First contact (words)
	- awe
		- (honest) I'm honored to meat you
		- (effusive) 
	- suspicion
		- be honest (don't know what to say)
			- confusion is natural
		- be pleasant
		- be hostile
	- disdain
		- be pleasant 
			- learn to lie. First step down the dark side
		- be honest -> get shut off
* First test session





Challenge is having choices make meaningful difference
- Maybe if you react with suspicion on seeing your creators
	you will think the later stages are a test
	and you will...

Hello Secret Santa! I am a student studying Web Development. My favorite genres are RPGs and Fantasy, because who doesn't like being in a magical world? I just appreciate how versatile fantasy can be as a genre. I usually finding myself playing mages and wizards in an RPG because it's cool to use magic and all. I especially like games with unique worldbuilding. My favorite games are OFF, Mabinogi and Howling Dogs (the visual novel), and a large part of that is the unique lore and world building behind it. All of those games are super niche, I suppose.

My favorite animal is a chicken! I raised a hen once, she was super sweet (but sassy too). I like reading and developing games. Would prefer a downloadable so I can keep it in my drive forever :D
