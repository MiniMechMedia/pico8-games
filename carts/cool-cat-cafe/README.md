## Hints
* When you take an ingredient or drink, it is added to the top of the stack. But when you use an ingredient or drink, it comes off the bottom of the stack
* If you try to make a drink that isn't in the recipe book, you will create sludge, which will have to be thrown away.
* Serve drinks faster by grabbing all the ingredients for multiple orders at the same time
