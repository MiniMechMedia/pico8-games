## Controls
* Arrow Keys - turn police car
* X - restart the game when the game ends



## Hints
* Stay on the perp's tail and you will slowly build speed
* You don't have to follow the perp's every move - see if 
you can anticipate their actions and head them off
    * Don't let them get too far away though, or they will escape!
