One of the things my giftee's letter mentioned is that they were a fan of [Howling Dogs](https://xrafstar.monster/games/twine/howlingdogs/),
an interactive fiction game written with Twine. This worked out well because I had been toying with the idea of a visual
novel in PICO-8 ever since getting access to Dalle-2. Thank you giftee, for providing the
perfect opportunity to make it happen!
