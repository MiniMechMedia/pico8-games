# Kaiju Companions
It took everything humanity had to defeat the kaiju, but death isn't the end
for them... Through our patented DNA recombination technology, you can 
own a miniature clone of your very own kaiju, available in all varieties
of shapes, colors, and patterns! Here at Kaiju Companions, we make the 
horrible adorable!  
  
Cross breed the eggs to match the kaiju that a customer has ordered.
