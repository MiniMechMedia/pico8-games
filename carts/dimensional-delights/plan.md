TODO
* Level up
    - Should be after a predetermined time... one minute?
* Game over screen
* Storyline
    - A lot of text...
* Draw character with wrench
    - maybe animate wrench
* Have launchers break down
    - What happens if you don't repair?
    - Because it's kind of a good thing...
    - Have to repair all before you move on?
* Draw different flavors (be quick about it)
* Alternate dimension
* Maybe draw the Caramel Core and have it meltdown
    - Could be fun to have hoses leading to each of the ice cream cones...
* Powerups...
    - maybe unnecessary
* Have boss talk to you in marquee
* smoke particles...
* Show countdown in bottom screen
* Game over screen should show cute picture
* Delay before each level (not terribly necessary since easy restart...)
