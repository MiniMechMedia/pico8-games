                        Description: Shoot down enemy planes. Your projectiles are *hard* and *fast* - just not at the same time. 

Cannonballs are slow but can destroy planes. Bubbles are fast and don't do damage, but they can move cannonballs off course.

                        Controls: * Arrow Keys - move your plane
* Z - shoot bubble
* X - shoot cannonball
