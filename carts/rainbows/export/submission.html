<p>Enemy missiles are inbound. Defend yourself using the Radial Anti-Inbound Non-Ballistic 
Offensive Weapon System.</p>
<p>Shoot down the missiles with a missile of the same color. Hybrid-colored missiles need 
to be shot down with missiles of each primary color (e.g. a green missile must be shot 
with both a blue and yellow missile). Hybrid-colored missiles do more damage if they hit you.</p>
