# R.A.I.N.B.O.W.S.
Enemy missiles are inbound. Defend yourself using the Radial Anti-Inbound Non-Ballistic 
Offensive Weapon System.

Shoot down the missiles with a missile of the same color. Hybrid-colored missiles need 
to be shot down with missiles of each primary color (e.g. a green missile must be shot 
with both a blue and yellow missile). Hybrid-colored missiles do more damage if they hit you.

Survive 10 waves to win!
