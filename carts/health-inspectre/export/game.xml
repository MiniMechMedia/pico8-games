                        Description: You are an inspector examining the basement of a condemned office. 
You discovered something worse than the numerous OSHA violations - ghosts!

Make your way to the basement's exit, without getting caught by the ghosts!
If a ghost catches sight of your flashlight it will come closer, but you can hide 
in the darkness safely. But if the ghost gets too close and _you_ catch sight of 
_it_, it will chase you even in the dark.

                        Controls: * Arrow Keys - Move
* X - Toggle flashlight
