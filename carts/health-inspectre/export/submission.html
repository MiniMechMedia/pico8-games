<p>Hide in the darkness or get caught by ghosts!</p>
<!-- BREAK -->

<p>You are an inspector examining the basement of a condemned office. 
You discovered something worse than the numerous OSHA violations - ghosts!</p>
<p>Make your way to the basement's exit, without getting caught by the ghosts!
If a ghost catches sight of your flashlight it will come closer, but you can hide 
in the darkness safely. But if the ghost gets too close and <em>you</em> catch sight of 
<em>it</em>, it will chase you even in the dark.</p>
<h2>Controls</h2>
