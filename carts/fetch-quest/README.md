# Fetch Quest
Run and jump along the walls of the space station to eat bones. 
Don't eat the radio-active red bone though!

## Controls
* Arrow Keys - move
* X - jump / restart on game over



## Hints
* After jumping, your controls have no effect until you hit the wall
* When you eat bones in free fall, you build up a multiplier that makes the next bone worth more
